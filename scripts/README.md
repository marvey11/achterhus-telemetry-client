# Utility scripts

These scripts support development, container start-up, and user-level systemd
deployment for the service orchestrator.

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`bootstrap.sh`](bootstrap.sh) | Sets up a development checkout. It checks for `uv` and a Git checkout, installs the locked project dependencies (including extras and development dependencies), then installs the pre-commit and pre-push hooks. Run it from within the checkout. |
| [`run-coverage.sh`](run-coverage.sh) | Runs the full pytest suite with coverage for `orchestrator` and enforces an 80% minimum. It always prints a terminal report with missing lines; pass `--html`, `--xml`, or `--all` to also generate HTML, XML, or both reports. |
